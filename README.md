### Building a Robot for the World Robot Olympiads (WRO)

**Introduction**

The primary objective of our robot is to complete a series of challenges across two distinct rounds. In the first round, the robot must complete three laps on a designated track. The second round adds complexity, requiring the robot to navigate the same track but with the addition of red and green obstacles. The competition we are participating in is the World Robot Olympiads (WRO), an international event that brings together young minds passionate about robotics and computer science. Our team is driven by a keen interest in computer science and a desire to test our skills and creativity in a competitive environment.

**Planning and Design**

The initial phase of our project involved extensive planning and brainstorming. Inspired by the sleek and efficient design of Formula 1 cars, we aimed to create a robot that combined speed with precision. Our robot, a LEGO Mindstorms Robot Inventor 51515, was chosen for its versatility and the advanced features of its native programming environment available on the Microsoft Store. 

We utilized components from the EV3 construction kit to build our robot. The design incorporated two motors for movement, an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection, and a color sensor to distinguish between red and green obstacles. Initially, our plan was to use an EV3 model, which we had already assembled. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, we had to switch to the LEGO Mindstorms Robot Inventor 51515. This change presented a significant challenge, requiring us to adapt our design and assembly process quickly.

**Construction of the Robot**

The construction phase was both exciting and challenging. Using the components available in the EV3 kit, we meticulously assembled our robot. The transition from the EV3 model to the LEGO Mindstorms Robot Inventor 51515 required us to rethink our approach and make several adjustments. The most significant difficulty we encountered was the initial imprecision of our robot. To address this, we fine-tuned the robot's movement by adjusting the degrees of rotation before and after calibration. This iterative process, though time-consuming, was crucial to ensuring the robot's accuracy and reliability.

The entire assembly process took approximately two weeks. Despite the tight timeline, we remained focused and determined, constantly testing and refining our design to overcome any challenges that arose.

**Programming and Control**

Programming the robot was a critical aspect of our project. We used the native language of the LEGO Mindstorms application, which is similar to Scratch. Given the limited time available, we opted for a straightforward approach for the first round, programming the robot's movements by degrees. This method allowed us to complete the first round's objective within the constraints we faced.

However, for the upcoming regional competition, we plan to enhance our robot's capabilities by incorporating logic and sensor-based programming. This will enable the robot to respond dynamically to the obstacles on the track, improving its performance and adaptability.

**Testing and Evaluation**

Testing was an integral part of our preparation. We conducted numerous trials to evaluate the robot's performance and identify areas for improvement. The initial tests highlighted several issues, including the robot's imprecise movements and difficulty in detecting obstacles accurately. Through careful calibration and adjustments, we were able to resolve these issues and improve the robot's reliability.

The limited capabilities of our kit posed some constraints on the robot's performance. Despite these limitations, our testing process helped us make significant improvements and prepare the robot for the competition.

**Participation in the Competition**

The World Robot Olympiads provided an exciting and challenging platform to showcase our robot. The experience of participating in such a prestigious event was invaluable. During the competition, our robot demonstrated its ability to complete the laps and navigate obstacles, although not without some difficulties. The feedback from judges and observations from other teams offered valuable insights into potential enhancements and strategies for future competitions.

**Conclusion**

Reflecting on our journey, we recognize the immense value of the experience. The challenges we faced and the solutions we developed have significantly enriched our understanding of robotics and teamwork. This project has not only honed our technical skills but also reinforced the importance of perseverance and adaptability.

Looking ahead, we plan to continue refining our robot, incorporating more advanced programming techniques and optimizing its design. Our goal is to achieve better performance in future competitions and continue exploring the fascinating world of robotics.

In conclusion, participating in the World Robot Olympiads has been a transformative experience. It has fueled our passion for robotics and inspired us to pursue further challenges in this exciting field. We are eager to apply the lessons learned and continue our journey of innovation and discovery.
